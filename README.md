# Array Concept Review Lab

## Learning Goals

- Perform operations on `Array`s

## Introduction

Let's practice `Array` operations. As you practice, consider the use of methods
that were built into the `Enumerable` and `Array` classes. Knowing built-in Ruby
libraries saves time and prevents bugs.

## Perform Operations on Arrays

### `#using_max`

Define a method that finds the highest number in a given `Array`.

### `#find_nth_element`

Define a method that finds Nemo in a nested `Array`.

### `#flatten_nested_arrays`

Define a method that flattens a nested `Array`.

### `#flatten_then_sort`

Define a method that flattens the nested `Array`, and then returns the previous
`Array` sorted alphabetically.

## Conclusion

There are several methods built into Ruby libraries that help you work with data
in `Array`s. By using these, you will avoid errors and make your code as clear as
possible.
